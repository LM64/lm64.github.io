      <legend><b>We've proven its existence multiple times.</b></legend>
      <ul>
        <li>Our planet's temperature has risen about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit since the 19th century, around the time as and due to the Industrial Revolution.</li>
        <li>The surface of the ocean (top 2,300 feet) has increased more than 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit in temperature since 1969.</li>
        <li>The sea level rose around 8 inches this last century partially due to melting sea ice. </li>
        <li>Speaking of which, polar ice caps lost 286 billion tons of ice between 1993 and 2016, and losses continue to increase.</li>
        <li>Seas are growing dangerously acidic (about 30 percent more acidic since the Industrial Revolution), due to human carbon emissions.</li>

      <legend><b>Scary stuff, huh? Well, wait until you see what damage it may do to life.</b></legend>
      <ul>
        <li>Rising sea levels may submerge entire island countries, as well as some continental coastal settlements.</li>
        <li>The Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems may be eventually too small and warm to harbor their endemic life, causing extinction.</li>
        <li>Increasing tempeatures may lead to more forest fires, eliminating unique ecosystems around the planet and killing off plants that are essential to some people.</li>
        <li>Extreme weather manifestations like hurricanes and heat waves will only get more frequent and numerous.</li>
        <li>Worst case scenario-<i>another mass extinction of life on Earth.</i></li>

  <h3>The fate of this amazing planet of ours rests in our hands. <i>Ready to see some change?</i></h3>

    <legend>These organizations are just a few dedicated to ending this catastrophe, <b>and they would love your help:</b></legend>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://worldwildlife.org">WORLD WILDLIFE FUND:</a> For nearly 60 years, World Wildlife Fund has been specializing in directly maintaining troubled ecosystems and species and working with those who live nearby them to live sustainable lives without causing a large impact on the environment. They offer a monthly donation program as well as an "adopt-an-animal" service where all money spent will go directly towards their preservation.</li>
      <li><a href="https://rainforest-alliance.org">RAINFOREST ALLIANCE:</a> The Rainforest Alliance works to ensure that the massive carbon sinks that are Earth's rainforets stay alive and thriving, ensuring that they will be able to remove massive amounts of dangerous carbon dioxide from our atmosphere. When shopping, keep an eye out for their "green frog seal". It will help you find products that were made primarily with the longevity of the rainforests in mind</li>
      <li><a href="https://350.org">350:</a> 350 fights for a fossil-fuel-free future, which eliminates possibly some of the largest producers of carbon emissions. Since 2008, they've worked tirelessly to transition to renewable energy, end new drilling projects, and cut all funding towards the companies who are responsible. They have local charters which carry out this goal, which are located all around the world. Who knows- there may be one close by for you to join!</li>
    </ul>
  </fieldset>
</br>
  <fieldset id="home_solutions">
    <legend>In addition, here are some of the many things you can do yourself to aid in the effort.</legend>
    <ul>
      <li>Turn off and unplug appliances/chargers when you're not using them.</li>
      <li>Eat less meat. This doesn't necessarily mean stop eating it all together, just maybe don't eat it everyday.</li>
      <li>Switch to renewable energy for your electricity, such as solar.</li>
      <li><b>VOTE!</b> Support legislation and political candidates that aim to reverse climate change.</li>
    </ul>
